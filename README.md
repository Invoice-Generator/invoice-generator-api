## About

We created a simple API at Invoiced to generate invoice PDFs on the fly. This service has been used internally by us for some time. We believe this could be helpful in your project as well.

The API only has a single endpoint that returns a PDF. We don't store any of your invoice data.

### Use Cases
- Creating invoices for VAT compliance
- Generate a PDF of an invoice that you have the details to (recipieint, line items, etc)
- Produce invoices for B2B buyers from an order or receipt
- Selling products or services on credit terms

### Endpoint

```
https://invoice-generator.com
```

### VAT Example

### Line Items

Line items are represented as an array of objects. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "Gizmo",
      "quantity": 10,
      "unit_cost": 99.99,
      "description": "The best gizmos there are around."
    }
    {
      "name": "Gizmo v2",
      "quantity": 5,
      "unit_cost": 199.99
    }
  ]
}
```

### Subtotal Lines

The `fields` object toggles the `discounts`, `tax`, and `shipping` subtotal lines. Each setting can have a value of `%`, `true`, or `false`. For example to add a percent tax rate and flat shipping to your invoice you would send this:

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "tax": "%",
    "discounts": false,
    "shipping": true
  },
  "tax": 7,
  "shipping": 15
}
```

### Custom Fields

Custom fields allow you to add additional fields to the invoice details in the top-right. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "custom_fields": [
    {
      "name": "Gizmo",
      "value": "PO-1234"
    }
    {
      "name": "Account Number",
      "value": "CUST-456"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rate Limiting

The invoice-generator.com API is rate limited. With almost every use case this should not be an issue. If an API call does trigger rate limiting then we will respond with a `429` status code to let you know to try generating your invoice again later. If you frequently run into these limits then you might also consider using our paid service at [invoiced.com](https://invoiced.com).
